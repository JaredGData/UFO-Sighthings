# UFO-Sighthings

Overview

This project is a Power BI portfolio project created while learning and applying core Data Analyst / Business Intelligence skills.Using a public UFO sightings dataset, the report focuses on data cleaning, modelling, analysis, and visual storytelling rather than the subject matter itself. The goal is to demonstrate how raw data can be transformed into clear, actionable insights using Power BI.

Project Goals

Demonstrate end-to-end BI workflow (data ingestion → transformation → modelling → reporting)
- Apply Power Query best practices for data cleaning
- Build a clean and scalable data model
- Use DAX for calculated columns and measures
- Design intuitive, stakeholder-friendly dashboards
- Practice analytical thinking and insight generation

Key Insights Explored
- Trend analysis of sightings by year and month
- Identification of seasonality and spikes in reported activity
- Geographic distribution by country, state, and city
- Frequency analysis of reported UFO shapes
- Time-based patterns (time of day vs volume)

Power Query: data cleaning, type casting, column splitting, and transformations
- Date and time extraction for temporal analysis
- Data modelling with relationships
- DAX measures and calculated columns
- Interactive slicers and filters
- Drill-down, cross-filtering, and tooltips
- Clean visual design using charts, tables, and maps

Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preparation
= BI dashboard development
- DAX fundamentals
- Data modelling concepts
- Insight communication and storytelling
